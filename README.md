# Humble Superhero API

## Project Overview
A simple API that allows users to add superheroes with their name, superpower, and humility score. Users can retrieve a list of superheroes sorted by humility score.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the backend: `npm start`
4. Run tests: `npm test`

## API Endpoints
- **POST /superheroes**: Add a superhero (requires `name`, `superpower`, `humilityScore` between 1-10)
- **GET /superheroes**: Fetch all superheroes sorted by humility score

## Future Improvements
- Implement authentication (JWT/OAuth)
- Use a real database for persistent storage
- Improve test coverage with integration tests

## Collaboration & Teamwork
To expand this project, teammates can implement additional features like search, filters, and superhero updates. Using Git for branching and PR reviews ensures smooth collaboration.
